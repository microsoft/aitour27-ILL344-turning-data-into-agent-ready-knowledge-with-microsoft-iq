At any point during the lab, if you need to sign in to the virtual machine (Windows) or any Azure or Microsoft 365 apps (M365 Copilot, SharePoint, Teams, and so on), use the credentials provided below.

## Sign into virtual machine (Windows)

If you need to sign in the virtual machine, use the following credentials:

- **User name**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base).Username+++  
- **Password**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base).Password+++

## Sign into Azure & Microsoft 365

If you need to sign in to any Azure or Microsoft 365 apps, use the following credentials:

- **Username**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++  
- **Temporary Access Pass**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken+++

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll build a Foundry IQ (Azure AI Search) knowledge base using agentic retrieval and extend it with Fabric IQ and Work IQ knowledge sources. You'll connect the knowledge base to indexed enterprise content, structured operational data, and workplace context for grounded, citation-backed answers across multiple systems.

Through 4 progressive notebook exercises, you'll build a multi-source document-backed knowledge base, add Fabric IQ and Work IQ, and finish by combining Work IQ and Fabric IQ in one KB. By the end, you'll have flexible agentic knowledge bases that blend multiple source types.

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to set up your environment and begin the lab.

### Sign into Windows

In the virtual machine, sign into Windows using the following credentials:

- **User name**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base).Username+++  
- **Password**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base).Password+++

### Access the lab repository

Once signed in to the Skillable environment, you'll find the lab repository already cloned on your desktop under the folder: **Desktop > aitour-ILL344**.

> This folder contains all the code, notebooks, and resources you'll need for the lab.

### Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code and select **File > Open Folder**. Then navigate to Desktop and select the **aitour-ILL344** folder and then **Select Folder**.

> [!TIP]
>
> - When prompted whether to trust the authors of the files, select **Yes, I trust the authors**.

### Verify the environment setup

All required Azure services including **Foundry IQ (Azure AI Search) with pre-indexed data** and **Azure OpenAI deployments** have already been provisioned for you.

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 What's pre-configured (click to expand for details)</strong></summary>

- **Foundry IQ (Azure AI Search)** - Standard tier with two pre-created indexes
- **supplier-evidence:** Supplier invoices, shipment evidence, and quality records
- **sourcing-documents:** RFP responses, agreements, purchase orders, and sourcing diagrams
- **Azure OpenAI** - Deployed models **gpt-5.4** for chat completion and answer synthesis and **text-embedding-3-large** for vector embeddings
- **Pre-computed vectors** - All Caldova document chunks are already vectorized and indexed

</details>

#### Verify environment variables

1. Open the **.env** file under the main project folder.  
2. Verify that it includes these environment variables:
   - *AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT*
   - *AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY*
   - *AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT*
   - *AZURE_OPENAI_KEY*
   - *AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT*
   - *AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_MODEL_NAME*
   - *AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT*
   - *AZURE_TENANT_ID*
   - *FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID*
   - *FABRIC_ONTOLOGY_ID*

If these variables are present, proceed to verify the indexes in Azure Portal.

#### Verify indexes in Azure Portal

Confirm that the search indexes have been created successfully:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the +++https://portal.azure.com+++.
2. Sign in using your lab credentials:
    - **Username**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++  
    - **Temporary Access Pass**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken+++
3. In the Azure Portal search bar at the top, search for +++ill344-search+++ and select your AI Search service (it will look like *ill344-search-.....*).
4. In the left navigation menu, select **Search management** > **Indexes**.
5. You should see two indexes:
   - **supplier-evidence** - Should show a nonzero document count
   - **sourcing-documents** - Should show a nonzero document count

If your indexes are present and populated, your environment is ready to use. You can now proceed to start with the Jupyter notebooks.

### Work through the Jupyter notebooks

This lab includes 4 progressive notebooks covering different knowledge base and source type patterns:

1. **Multi-source search indexes** - Build a knowledge base over those search indexes plus an uploaded file
2. **Fabric IQ source** - Add Fabric IQ through a Fabric Ontology knowledge source
3. **Work IQ source** - Bring Work IQ into the KB as a first-party source, authenticated based on your user login
4. **Work IQ + Fabric IQ** - Combine workplace data and structured Fabric data in one knowledge base

Start with **part1-standard-foundry-iq-kb.ipynb** in the **src/notebooks/** folder and progress through each notebook sequentially.

> [!TIP]
> **Bonus: Copilot CLI sidequest** - Part 1 includes a bonus section that prints an MCP configuration for the knowledge base you created. Follow the instructions in **src/notebooks/copilot-cli-sidequest.md** to add it to GitHub Copilot CLI and query your KB directly from the terminal.

Once you've completed all 4 notebooks, select **Next** to review key takeaways and next steps.
