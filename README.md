## Before you're done

This repo has been created for your AI Tour 2027 session. Here's how to get it ready.

**Easiest path — use the agent (recommended):**

- Open GitHub Copilot Chat and say `help me initialize repo`. The agent will walk you through getting the README populated.
- When you're ready to publish, say `help me finalize repo`. The agent will clean up unused folders, validate everything, and remove this "Before you're done" section and other extra stuff that attendees don't need to see.
- Curious how it works? Read the [agent workflow](.github/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md).

**Doing it manually?**

Fill in the sections below yourself, then:

- Delete any placeholder folders you don't need (`data/`, `infra/`, etc.)
- Delete this "Before you're done" section
- Delete `.github/agents/`, `.github/tests/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.github/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` — these are template tooling, not part of your published repo

**Folder conventions:**

- Attendee step-by-step guidance goes in `instructions/`. If you use MkDocs or a docs site instead, put it in `docs/` and link to it from this README.
- Reference material and background reading go in `docs/`.
- Presenter notes, deck link, recordings, and re-delivery materials go in `delivery-resources/`. Fill in [`delivery-resources/README.md`](delivery-resources/README.md).
- You can add a `.devcontainer/` folder if needed.

## 🔥 ILL344: Turning data into agent-ready knowledge with Microsoft IQ

### Session description

Use Foundry IQ to build a multi-source knowledge base with agentic retrieval, Fabric IQ to retrieve data from OneLake & Work IQ to include org data and build an agent using the combined retrieval power of the IQs to reason across files, data, & work signals.​

### 🚀 Getting started

#### In a guided session

If you're following along during a live session:

1. Open the lab environment and sign in with the provided credentials.
2. Follow the setup guidance in [`instructions/overview.md`](instructions/overview.md).
3. Open [`src/notebooks/`](src/notebooks/), start with [`part1-standard-foundry-iq-kb.ipynb`](src/notebooks/part1-standard-foundry-iq-kb.ipynb), and work through all five notebooks sequentially.

#### On your own

If you're learning at your own pace:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Provision the required resources by following the [self-deployment guide](deploy_yourself.md).
3. Follow [`instructions/overview.md`](instructions/overview.md), then work through all five notebooks in [`src/notebooks/`](src/notebooks/) sequentially.

### 🎯 Learning outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Build a multi-source knowledge base over indexed enterprise content using Azure AI Search agentic retrieval.
- Extend a knowledge base with Fabric IQ and Work IQ knowledge sources.
- Build a Python agent using Microsoft Agent Framework with answers grounded in a Foundry IQ knowledge base.
- Combine indexed, structured, workplace, and web-grounded sources in one knowledge base and query it with citation-backed answer synthesis.

### 💻 Technologies used

- Foundry IQ (Azure AI Search)
- Azure OpenAI (`gpt-5.4-mini` and `text-embedding-3-large`)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Microsoft Fabric IQ and Work IQ
- Python and Jupyter Notebooks
